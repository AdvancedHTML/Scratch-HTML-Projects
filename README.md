Ok, this is just a little site where I put HTML files for Scratch projects I have converted using TurboWarp, so if you you download them, you can use them on your
computer if your WiFi goes down. You can copy anything you want from this, and script.js file and the html file (NOT the index.html file) are useless, and I don't know
how to delete them.
